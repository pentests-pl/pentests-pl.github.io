Hello! Before doctors could declare this blog completely dead I decided to bring
it back to live (well more or less). First step is done. I've moved it to Github
pages and Jekyll. Why? Because Markdown FTW! This hopefully will allow me to post
more stuff here without need to spend hours clicking through UIs. Will it work?
Only time will show ;)
